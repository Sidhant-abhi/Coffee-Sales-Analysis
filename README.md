### ‚è©Situation:

Our current sales analysis methods lack the depth and clarity needed to optimize our coffee business. We struggle to identify top-selling products, peak customer hours, and branch performance variations. This lack of visibility creates blind spots and hinders our ability to make data-driven decisions that could significantly boost our sales and profitability.

### ‚è©Task:

As a data analyst, I was tasked with analyzing these trends to identify areas for improvement and suggest data-driven recommendations.

### ‚è©Action:

‚úÖ I leveraged the coffee report dashboards using Power-BI and Power Query to conduct a deep dive into Total Sales, Orders, and Products.

‚úÖ I have used Advanced SQL Queries to load and extract data into the database for further analysis. I have used several **Windows** functions in it.

‚úÖ Moreover, I have used **KPI's** for Total sales, Orders and Quantity sold. Used charts to differentiate sales on the basis of product category, type and store locations.

‚úÖ Explored sales data using our interactive calendar with useful tooltips.

### ‚è©Result:

‚úÖ The **20%** sales increase observed during the summer months (June-August) suggests strategic opportunities for promoting refreshing summer drinks or iced coffee promotions in the coming year to capitalize on this seasonal demand.

‚úÖ The chart indicates that iced lattes and cold brew coffee were the top sellers during the summer months.

‚úÖ The map highlights a consistent sales increase in our downtown location compared to our suburban branch.

‚úÖ The line graph reveals a surge in customer traffic coinciding with our afternoon happy hour promotion, showing a **30%** increase in traffic compared to pre-promotion hours.
