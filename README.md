### ⏩Situation:

Our current sales analysis methods lack the depth and clarity needed to optimize our coffee business. We struggle to identify top-selling products, peak customer hours, and branch performance variations. This lack of visibility creates blind spots and hinders our ability to make data-driven decisions that could significantly boost our sales and profitability.

### ⏩Task:

As a data analyst, I was tasked with analyzing these trends to identify areas for improvement and suggest data-driven recommendations.

### ⏩Action:

✅ I leveraged the coffee report dashboards using Power-BI and Power Query to conduct a deep dive into Total Sales, Orders, and Products.

✅ I have used Advanced SQL Queries to load and extract data into the database for further analysis. I have used several **Windows** functions in it.

✅ Moreover, I have used **KPI's** for Total sales, Orders and Quantity sold. Used charts to differentiate sales on the basis of product category, type and store locations.

✅ Explored sales data using our interactive calendar with useful tooltips.

### ⏩Result:

✅ The **20%** sales increase observed during the summer months (June-August) suggests strategic opportunities for promoting refreshing summer drinks or iced coffee promotions in the coming year to capitalize on this seasonal demand.

✅ The chart indicates that iced lattes and cold brew coffee were the top sellers during the summer months.

✅ The map highlights a consistent sales increase in our downtown location compared to our suburban branch.

✅ The line graph reveals a surge in customer traffic coinciding with our afternoon happy hour promotion, showing a **30%** increase in traffic compared to pre-promotion hours.
